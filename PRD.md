# Product Requirements Document: Palo Alto Networks AI Security Python SDK Examples Repository

## Introduction

This document outlines the plan to create a comprehensive reference repository of examples for working with the Palo Alto Networks AI Security Python SDK (aisecurity). The repository will serve as a learning resource for developers looking to integrate AI security scanning into their Python applications. This project will focus **exclusively on the Python SDK** and will not cover other language implementations.

## Product Vision

To create the most comprehensive, well-documented, and practical collection of examples for the Palo Alto Networks AI Security SDK, enabling developers to quickly adopt best practices for securing their AI applications against various threats.

## Target Audience

- Software developers integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications
- Security engineers implementing safeguards around AI systems
- DevSecOps teams establishing secure AI pipelines
- Solution architects designing secure AI architectures

## Business Objectives

1. Accelerate adoption of Palo Alto Networks AI Security solutions
2. Reduce implementation time for customers integrating the SDK
3. Demonstrate best practices for securing AI applications
4. Showcase the breadth of security features available in the SDK
5. Provide a learning resource for developers new to AI security

## Current Status

The repository currently contains several example scripts demonstrating different patterns for using the AI Security Python SDK. However, these examples are based on an older version of the SDK and require refactoring to work with the latest version:

- Basic synchronous scanning (main.py) - needs refactoring
- Detailed synchronous scanning (sync_scan.py) - needs refactoring
- Batch processing with asynchronous API (async_scan.py) - needs refactoring
- Concurrent processing with asyncio (asyncio_concurrent.py) - needs refactoring
- Decorator pattern for automatic scanning (decorator_example.py) - needs refactoring
- Mock implementations for testing (mock_example.py) - needs refactoring
- Utility functions (utils.py) - needs refactoring

Each example has corresponding markdown documentation that also needs to be updated to match the refactored code and latest SDK functionality.

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Refactoring Existing Examples

- Update all example scripts to work with the latest version of the Python SDK
